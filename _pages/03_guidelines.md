## Logomarks

ACM at UCLA logomarks are visual cues of what each committees, and ACM as a whole, does. 

### Spacing and Sizing 

Standard logomark images are pre-formatted to meet clearspace requirements. In cases where you need to modify these assests to create custom logomarks, use the following templates to maintain sufficent clearspace. 
{% include "assetbox-template-large.html", title: "Download Template" , file: "partials/large-partial-01.svg" %}
{% include "assetbox-template-large.html", title: "Download Template" , file: "partials/large-partial-02.png" %}

For stand-alone logos, use the following template.
For wordmarks-logo combo, use the following template. If no committee name is present, remove the dot and treat the ‘m’ as the rightmost character. 


### Color
All logos come in two types - light and dark. Makes sure to use the version that maintains a color contrast of at least 0.7 between the background and the color of the diamond. 

{% include "ok-bad-partials.html", title: "OK", file: "partials/acmGood01partial.svg" %}
{% include "ok-bad-partials.html", title: "OK", file: "partials/acmGood02partial.svg" %}
{% include "ok-bad-partials.html", title: "BAD", file: "partials/acmBad03partial.svg" %}
{% include "ok-bad-partials.html", title: "BAD", file: "partials/acmBad04partial.svg" %}

## Wordmarks

ACM at UCLA Wordmarks are used when the name of the comittee has to be clarified. Nuilt using the proprietary Westwood Sans font, they are designed to be legiable in large print while keeping it aligned with ACM’s geometric art style. They can either be used alongside the logomark, or by itself.

### Spacing and Sizing
Standard logomark images are pre-formatted to meet clearspace requirements. In cases where you need to modify these assests to create custom logomarks, use the following templates to maintain sufficent clearspace. 

For wordmarks-logo combo, use the following template. Note that this is the same as the template in the “Logomark” section
For wordmarks-logo combo, use the following template. If no committee name is present, remove the dot and treat the ‘m’ as the rightmost character.

{% include "assetbox-template-large.html", title: "Download Template" , file: "partials/spacing-01.png" %}
{% include "assetbox-template-large.html", title: "Download Template" , file: "partials/spacing-02.svg" %}

### Color
Comittee wordmarks, in addition to light/dark versions, have a “basic” version and the gradient version. Whenever possible, the gradient version should be used. The basic version should be reserved for cases where colors are limited, such as physical merchendise, or when the gradient has a low color contrast compared to the background 
{% include "ok-bad-partials.html", title: "OK", file: "partials/color-good-01.svg" %}
{% include "ok-bad-partials.html", title: "OK", file: "partials/color-good-02.svg" %}
{% include "ok-bad-partials.html", title: "BAD", file: "partials/color-bad-01.svg" %}
{% include "ok-bad-partials.html", title: "BAD", file: "partials/color-bad-01.svg" %}


### In Type
When typing out wordmarks as text, capitalize ACM as well as the first letter in the second word. The dot should be converted to a space.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/partials/in-type.svg"
    alt="In Type Graphic"
    style="width:80%; margin:2rem 0; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" />



To add subtitles, use a vertical line separated by a single space:
#### ACM Hack | Hackschool Series

## Compliance
In order to comply with UCLA and ACM’s branding plicies, there are several rules to follow.  

### UCLA Policies
These rules apply for all activities on campus

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/partials/ucla-compliance.png"
    alt="In Type Graphic"
    style="width:80%; margin:2rem 0; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" />

All official documents and mediums facing the general public must use the version superceded by “at UCLA”. Non-official materials (e.g. posters, fliers, social media posts) do not need the “at UCLA”

For committees, supercede the “at UCLA” after the full committee name.  

“UCLA” must be in all caps


### ACM Policies
These rules apply for all activities/materials **directly** dealing with **ACM HQ**.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/partials/acm-compliance.png"
    alt="In Type Graphic"
    style="width:80%; margin:2rem 0; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" />

Wordmarks are designed to be used on campus. Do not use them in relation to ACM HQ. 

When creating custom wordmarks or typing it out, use “UCLA ACM”

“ACM” and “UCLA” should be all caps


## Colors
Each committee, including the general ACM at UCLA, has 4 colors defined, as well as a “gradient”. 
{% include "guidelines-color-grid.html"%}

### Ratio
New ACM branding recommends light theme. The bottom chart shows a recommended ratios of colors. The exact ratios are not specified to allow flexibility in design.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/partials/ratio-guidelines.svg"
     alt="In Type Graphic"
     style="width:100%; height:auto; margin:2rem 0" />

## Typography
ACM at UCLA has 4 fonts defined for various uses

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/partials/westwood-sans.svg"
     alt="In Type Graphic"
     style="width:35%; height:auto; margin:2rem 0" />

#### Workmark Font
Westwood Sans is a proprietary font made by ACM to be used in wordmarks, and wordmarks only.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/partials/poppins.svg"
     alt="In Type Graphic"
     style="width:35%; height:auto; margin:2rem 0" />

#### Header Font
Poppins is the header font, used for headers in posters and websites. As such, any text using Poppins should not exceed about dozen words. For longer phrases, use the body font.   

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/partials/open-sans.svg"
     alt="In Type Graphic"
     style="width:35%; height:auto; margin:2rem 0" />

#### Body Font
Open Sans is the body text, generally used for sentences and paragraphs. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/partials/source-code-pro.svg"
     alt="In Type Graphic"
     style="width:35%; height:auto; margin:2rem 0" />

#### Code Font
Source Code Pro is used when writing code. 

## Art
ACM at UCLA, like many other tech-related organizations, predominatly use vector-based art, However, in order to help it stand out from other organizations, there are several key art directions to follow.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/partials/art01.svg"
     alt="In Type Graphic"
     style="width:25%; height:auto; margin:2rem 0" />

#### Vector is the Basics 
Pixel-based art should rarely, if ever, be used. This is to make inmplementations on digital media easier, as well as to speed up production.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/partials/art02.svg"
     alt="In Type Graphic"
     style="width:25%; height:auto; margin:2rem 0" />

#### Light Theme
ACM branding recommends light theme, and this should be applied to art as well.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/partials/art03.svg"
     alt="In Type Graphic"
     style="width:25%; height:auto; margin:2rem 0" />

#### Soak it up
The overall color of art should reflect the committee’s color palette - even for things that usually don’t have color. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/partials/art04.svg"
     alt="In Type Graphic"
     style="width:25%; height:auto; margin:2rem 0" />

#### Bold and Brilliant
Do not shy away from using vivid colors, unusual color palettes, etc. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/partials/art05.svg"
     alt="In Type Graphic"
     style="width:25%; height:auto; margin:2rem 0" />

#### Details
Strike a balance between realism and abstract. Above, the keyboard has detailed bumps, while indivisual letters are removed to avoid clutter.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/partials/art06.svg"
     alt="In Type Graphic"
     style="width:25%; height:auto; margin:2rem 0" />

#### Give it Depth
Whenever possible, create perception of depth using color, gradients, and/or shadows.

<!-- {% include "type.html", family: "Poppins", weight: "700" %}
As our main display typeface, [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins "Poppins on Google Fonts") is used for virtually all content with ACM branding. It's fun and friendly, and represents what we want our events to be like. As such, Poppins is the foundation for all our committees' wordmarks. We suggest using this whenever you want your content to have a strong association with ACM.

{% include "type.html", family: "Palanquin Dark", weight: "700" %}
[Palanquin Dark](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Palanquin+Dark "Palanquin Dark on Google Fonts") is our main header typeface, which we use on all our websites when we have copy/headings that speak, not show. It has a more organic vibe compared to Poppins. We suggest using Palanquin Dark on your website headings, but not for graphics.

{% include "type.html", family: "Chivo", weight: "400" %}
[Chivo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Chivo "Chivo on Google Fonts") is our main body typeface. It's design is more similar to tech aesthetics, and can be used for casual copy, or more serious situations. We suggest using Chivo for smaller UI elements and body text. -->
