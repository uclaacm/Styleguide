# What the font? #
UCLA ACM uses three main typefaces: Poppins, Palanquin Dark, and Chivo. 

{% include type.html family="Poppins" weight="700" %}
As our main display typeface, Poppins is used for virtually all content with ACM branding. It's fun and friendly, and represents what we want our events to be like. As such, Poppins is the foundation for all our committees' wordmarks. We suggest using this whenever you want your content to have a strong association with ACM.

{% include type.html family="Palanquin Dark" weight="700" %}
Palanquin Dark is our main header typeface, which we use on all our websites when we have copy/headings that speak, not show. It has a more organic vibe compared to Poppins. We suggest using Palanquin Dark on your website headings, but not for graphics.

{% include type.html family="Chivo" weight="400" %}
Chivo is our main body typeface. It's design is more similar to tech aesthetics, and can be used for casual copy, or more serious situations. We suggest using Chivo for smaller UI elements and body text.

There aren't really strict guidelines on how to use these typefaces—designing with them is up to your discretion. Likewise, there's no need to adhere to these type families, as they may change in the future. That being said, when in doubt and don't care about font specifics, use Poppins.
